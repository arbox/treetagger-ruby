== DESCRIPTION
A Ruby based wrapper for the TreeTagger by Helmut Schmid.

Check it out if you are interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and/or Human Language Technology (HLT).

This library provides comprehensive bindings for the
{TreeTagger}[http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/],
a statistical language independed POS tagging and chunking software.

TreeTagger is language agnostic, it will never guess what language you're going
to use.

TODO:
* References to Schmid's publications;
* How to use TreeTagger in the wild;
* Input and output format, tokenization;
